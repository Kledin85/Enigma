# Enigma Self Assessment

- For functionality I got my enigma class to encrypt and decrypt a message with the use of the command line so I believe I got a 3 there. for object oriented programming I want to say I got about a 2.5 because I only have one class, the enigma class, and one module for that class. There is probably ways to break this up into further classes but wasn't sure how to efficiently with the way I wrote my program. for Ruby conventions and methods I would give myself a 3 I used a wide variety of methods and enumerables and a variety of hashes and arrays. there could be a few method lines that are a little long. For test driven development I would give myself a 3. Simplecov passes with 100% and everything is tested for. Regarding version control I would give myself a 3.5 I have over 40 commits and more than 4 pull request though Im not sure if some of the pull request to do enough to be a solid pull request for example I made a pull request to just add simplecov to the project and I will be doing another one for this readme file. Do both of these warrant its own branch and a pull request? Overall I would give myself a 3 on the project. This project showed me what I still need to work on mainly when is a new class needed and how to implement it.
